# Summary: Latitude vs. X

Latitude is a dashboard for analyzing the effects of latitude on different climate factors . The purpose of Latitude is to analyze how weather changes as we move closer to the equator.

Data for more than 500 cities was compiled through the OpenWeatherAPI. Using the dataset, we utilized matplotlib, to plot various relationships of weather to latitude including:

Cloudiness
Humidity
Max Temperature
Wind Speed

Latitude includes the source data that was compiled in this analysis, as well as the output visualizations, and offers explanations and descriptions of trends we discovered in the course of our work.

The page was deployed using Github pages and can be viewed at: https://kevingray17.github.io/web-design-challenge/index.html
